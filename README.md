🦠 Determining the Herd Immunity Threshold for Ebola Virus Vaccine 🛡️
This project calculates the herd immunity threshold required for the Ebola virus vaccine to successfully control the spread of the virus within a population. The research combines mathematical modeling 🧮 and epidemiological data 📊 to provide insights into effective vaccination strategies.

🌟 Project Overview
Ebola is a highly infectious and deadly virus with significant public health implications. A key aspect of controlling its spread is understanding the level of vaccination needed to achieve herd immunity. This project explores the factors influencing the herd immunity threshold and presents a detailed analysis using mathematical models.

🎯 Objectives
🧬 Understand the basic reproduction number (R₀) of the Ebola virus.
🧮 Estimate the necessary percentage of the population that must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
🧪 Analyze the effectiveness of the vaccine under different scenarios, including varying R₀ values and vaccine efficacy rates.
📝 Methodology
Data Collection 📚: Gathered epidemiological data on the Ebola virus, including transmission rates and vaccine efficacy.
Mathematical Modeling 🧮: Utilized the basic reproduction number (R₀) to calculate the herd immunity threshold using the formula:

Simulation 🖥️: Conducted simulations to model the spread of the Ebola virus under different vaccination coverage scenarios.
Analysis 📈: Analyzed the results to determine the optimal vaccination coverage required to achieve herd immunity.
📊 Results
The study provides an estimated herd immunity threshold for the Ebola virus based on various R₀ values and vaccine efficacies. These findings can guide public health policies 🏥 to ensure adequate vaccine coverage in affected regions.
